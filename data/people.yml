  bio: promotes social innovation while helping coders improve their skills.
    CodeMontage was born out of the belief that computing is the most efficient
    way to improve the human experience, and that software developers become the
    best through lots of practice building real applications. We know from teaching
    beginners that there’s a frustrating gap between learning to code and being
    able to build robust applications, and we know from hiring and mentoring
    developers that experience can’t be replaced with canned tutorials.
