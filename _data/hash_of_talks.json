If that sounds terrifying—but also kinda exciting—then this workshop is for you. We’re Katel LeDû, CEO of indie tech publishing company A Book Apart, and Sara Wachter-Boettcher, a three-time author, and we know that too many valuable, interesting voices are still missing from our industry’s bookshelves. We’re here to help change that. In this workshop, we’ll demystify the publishing process and answer questions about contracts, proposals, and more. Then, you'll get to work: you’ll share ideas with us and each other, get feedback, decide on an angle and audience, and start drafting an elevator pitch and outline. You’ll leave the session with a clearer idea of what it takes to get a book published, and practical advice on turning your topic into something publishers—and readers—will love. Don’t worry about having The Perfect Idea™ before you come—just bring 1-2 topics you want to explore!",

How do you navigate it, understand it, and best support your teammate?\n\nIn this workshop, we’ll talk through humans’ six core needs in the workplace, what’s happening in our brains when we have surprising emotions, and how to recognize when your teammate is feeling some resistance or doubt. We’ll practice methods to unearth what might be behind those emotions, and we’ll cap it off by working through how to recover when you’ve triggered someone. Attendees will leave with tools and techniques to easily share with others so they, too, can know how to navigate these sticky moments.",

If you stop doing those things, the team will function less well. But now someone's suggesting that 'you might be happier in a less technical role'. \n\n'Glue' work often lands on the only woman on the team, and it needs to be framed carefully.

Many fledgling speakers find it challenging to string concepts together in an order that makes sense to other people. They also find themselves struggling to explain things in a way that feels approachable. In this talk, Catt will share methods to plan and present ideas so that your audience can better understand them.

In this session, I’ll tell you how I hacked my brain with psychology to change my work habits for the better, and how you can do the same.  I'll also touch on some lesser-known yet powerful editor features to supercharge your productivity.  Symbol finding, real-time collaborative text editing, built-in Git integration, folding, multiple cursors, bookmarks, and snippets: there's a lot you might not know a text editor can do.",
