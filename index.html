            Our community is open to and our content is designed for people whose gender or gender history is marginalized within tech. We define those gender groups as:</p>
            <ul style="padding-left: 1em; list-style-type: disc; margin: 1em 0;">
              <li>All women technologists (trans, non-binary, and cis)</li>
              <li>All trans technologists (trans women, trans men, and trans non-binary folks)</li>
              <li>All non-binary technologists (including GNC, gender-fluid, genderqueer, agender folks, etc)</li>
            </ul>
          <p class="qcTabDesc">We want to equip people from these groups to overcome both the internal and external effects of that marginalization by identifying, expanding, and sharing their expertise with the support of an engaged peer network.</p>
