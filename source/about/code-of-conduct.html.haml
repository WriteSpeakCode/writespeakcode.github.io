  Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy

%p
  Write/Speak/Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

%p
  This code of conduct applies to all Write/Speak/Code spaces both online
  and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or
  expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Write/Speak/Code.

%p
  Some Write/Speak/Code spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

%p
  Harassment includes:

  %ul

    %li
      Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.

      Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.

      ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’

    Staff Procedure for incident handling
%p
  %em
    Warnings
  %br/
  Any member of conference staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant
  that their behavior violates the conference's anti-harassment policy.
  Warnings should be reported to info@writespeakcode.com as soon as practical.

%p
  The report should include:

  %ul
    %li
      Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
    %li
      The time you issued the warning
    %li
      The behavior that was in violation
    %li
      The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of
      warning)
    %li
      The circumstances surrounding the incident
    %li
      Your identity
    %li
      Other people involved in the incident
%p
  %em
    Presentations
  %br/
  Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or
  minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the
  presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely
  and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously
  violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry,
  this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further
  explanation.
%p
  %em
    Taking Reports
  %br/
  When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record
  what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid
  making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask
  for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as
  time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant.
  Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person
  taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along
  to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for
  an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and
  contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any
  action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not
  sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not
  involved with the situation or non-staff members.
%p
  The report should include:
  %ul
    %li
      Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
    %li
      The time you issued the warning
    %li
      The behavior that was in violation
    %li
      The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of
      warning)
    %li
      The circumstances surrounding the incident
    %li
      Your identity
    %li
      Other people involved in the incident
%p
  %em
    Expulsion
  %br/
  A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed
  entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some
  general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:
  %ul
    %li
      A third offense resulting in a warning from staff
    %li
      Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
    %li
      A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
    %li
      A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
    %li
      A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)
%p
  Hotel/venue security and local authorities should be contacted when
  appropriate.
%p
  %em
    Public Statements
  %br/
  As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements
  about the behavior of individual people during or after the conference.
%p
  In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when
  necessary.
%p
  This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek
  Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
