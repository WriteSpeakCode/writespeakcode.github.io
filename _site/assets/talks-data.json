When it comes to tech, that means its women, and especially its women of color. And while there’s been a greater emphasis lately on rediscovering women’s contributions to technology, we need to expand our focus beyond just Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace.\n\nFrom Radia Perlman to Sophie Wilson to Erica Baker, it’s time to explore both tech’s forgotten heroes and its modern-day pioneers, and help end the silent erasure of women in technology."

If that sounds terrifying—but also kinda exciting—then this workshop is for you.\n\nWe’re Katel LeDû, CEO of indie tech publishing company A Book Apart, and Sara Wachter-Boettcher, a three-time author, and we know that too many valuable, interesting voices are still missing from our industry’s bookshelves. We’re here to help change that.\n\nWhat we’ll do\nIn this workshop, we’ll break down the publishing process, answering questions like:\nWhat are the different types of publishers out there?\nHow do you figure out the right market for your idea, and/or shape your idea to fit a market?\nWhat goes into a book proposal, and how will it be evaluated?\nWhat happens when you sign a book contract?\nHow does the editorial process work?\nAnd of course, will you make any money?\nThen, you'll get to work: you’ll share ideas with us and each other, get feedback, decide on an angle and audience, and start drafting an elevator pitch and outline. You’ll leave the session with a clearer idea of what it takes to get a book published, tools and templates you can use to build your proposal, and practical advice on turning your topic into something publishers—and readers—will love.\n\nWhat to bring\nYou don’t need to have The Perfect Idea™—and you don’t need to be an expert yet, either (here’s a secret: tons of authors become experts by researching and writing their books!). Just bring 1-2 topics you want to explore further. Ideally, your topic should be:\nSuper interesting to you! Remember, you’ll be working on this for months—so pick something you’re stoked to spend time on.\nUseful for your peers. This doesn’t have to mean “game-changing” or “brilliant”—just look for a problem people in your field have, or something that would help them do their jobs better.\nSubstantial enough to write a lot about. Try to brainstorm all the questions about this topic your peers might have (or ask them!).",

I initially began the activity to improve my confidence and logical reasoning skills, but soon learnt that the playing field was far from fair. Despite the fact that 50% of first-year debaters were young women, by the end of their time on the circuit, most high-performing speakers were male. In this talk, I'll discuss the impact of gender-coded communication patterns not only on competitive debating performance, but also more generally in boardrooms, team meetings, and other everyday settings for technologists. I'll present research carried out by a friend who wrote a PhD on this subject, as well as insights from the fields of linguistics and behavioral psychology.",
