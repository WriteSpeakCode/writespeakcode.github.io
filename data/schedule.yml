      Open source is the foundation on which the modern internet economy is built. 
      But women are significantly underrepresented in the community-- in fact,

      explore why participating in open source is so important, how it can be an 
      expression of our shared values, and discuss resources and strategies to 
      help women navigate and thrive in this often hostile environment.
