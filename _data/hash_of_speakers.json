I nabbed an operations role on an engineering team of 10, looking to establish themselves within a famous advertising agency. \n\nOver four years we grew the team by 700% - with creative engineers across five offices - and digital became half of the agency's revenue. The team built immersive web, mobile, social, experiential/ooh campaigns, and software for clients including Burger King, Microsoft, Old Navy, VW, Amex, Kraft and Domino's. They also claimed Digital Agency of the Year three times at Cannes. \n\nNeedless to say I was hooked and have since sought out companies and teams on the forefront of innovation - from wearables and home automation to music streaming and web hosting. I've also been lucky to learn from some of the brightest technology, creative, and strategic minds, furthering my understanding of how great teams are cultivated. \n\nWhile I've lead operations and resourcing for globally distributed engineering and design teams, my passion is for building and scaling them. Having said that, I believe deeply in growing talent from within. Partnering with CTOs, managers, and engineers to make talent acquisition (and cultivation) a holistic and participatory practice is an important part of my mission.",
