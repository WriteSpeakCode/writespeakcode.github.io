    talk_description: 
      Open source is the foundation on which the modern internet economy is built. 
      But women are significantly underrepresented in the community-- in fact, 
      only 10% of female developers contribute to open source. In this talk we will 
      explore why participating in open source is so important, how it can be an 
      expression of our shared values, and discuss resources and strategies to 
      help women navigate and thrive in this often hostile environment.
