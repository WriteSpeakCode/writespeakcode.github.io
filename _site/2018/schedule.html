Many fledgling speakers find it challenging to string concepts together in an order that makes sense to other people. They also find themselves struggling to explain things in a way that feels approachable. In this talk, Catt will share methods to plan and present ideas so that your audience can better understand them.

Been there, done that.

The interesting stories often aren’t the ones we grew up with; they’re the ones we’ve left behind. When it comes to tech, that means its women, and especially its women of color. And while there’s been a greater emphasis lately on rediscovering women’s contributions to technology, we need to expand our focus beyond just Grace Hopper and Ada Lovelace.

From Radia Perlman to Sophie Wilson to Erica Baker, it’s time to explore both tech’s forgotten heroes and its modern-day pioneers, and help end the silent erasure of women in technology.</p>

                        <p>Your job title says "engineer" and that's what you want to be, but you seem to spend most of your time in meetings. You'd like to have time for code, but nobody else is unblocking the junior engineers, maintaining the relationship with your sister team in the other office, updating the roadmap, talking to teams whose projects overlap with yours, noticing the things that got dropped, asking questions on design documents, and making sure that everyone's going roughly in the same direction. If you stop doing those things, the team will function less well. But now someone's suggesting that 'you might be happier in a less technical role'. 

'Glue' work often lands on the only woman on the team, and it needs to be framed carefully. If you display this kind of leadership early in your career, there's a real risk of being seen as 'not technical enough' and pushed off the engineer ladder. Let's talk about how to get you recognised as the technical leader that you are, and keep you on the path to being a senior engineer.</p>

                        <p>Developer tools can be an efficiency multiplier, but it's tough to balance time between "learning to use your tools better" and "getting things done."  When I started on the Atom Editor team, I learned about all these cool things a text editor can do, but I still found myself stuck in my old workflows.  In this session, I’ll tell you how I hacked my brain with psychology to change my work habits for the better, and how you can do the same.  I'll also touch on some lesser-known yet powerful editor features to supercharge your productivity.  Symbol finding, real-time collaborative text editing, built-in Git integration, folding, multiple cursors, bookmarks, and snippets: there's a lot you might not know a text editor can do.</p>

Why does trauma come in waves, washing over us again and again? Computational neuroscience provides insight into these questions and more.

                        <p>You’ve started blogging about your work. Awesome! So what about writing even more…like, say, a book? If that sounds terrifying—but also kinda exciting—then this workshop is for you. We’re Katel LeDû, CEO of indie tech publishing company A Book Apart, and Sara Wachter-Boettcher, a three-time author, and we know that too many valuable, interesting voices are still missing from our industry’s bookshelves. We’re here to help change that. In this workshop, we’ll demystify the publishing process and answer questions about contracts, proposals, and more. Then, you'll get to work: you’ll share ideas with us and each other, get feedback, decide on an angle and audience, and start drafting an elevator pitch and outline. You’ll leave the session with a clearer idea of what it takes to get a book published, and practical advice on turning your topic into something publishers—and readers—will love. Don’t worry about having The Perfect Idea™ before you come—just bring 1-2 topics you want to explore!</p>

Over time, this view is beginning to broaden. But just how much? Thanks to MoMA open sourcing data about their art collection, we can quantify the diversity of artists displayed at MoMA over time. Using data parsing and NLP, we will be better equipped to understand the evolution of acceptance of underrepresented groups in the art world.</p>

                        <p>Elixir is a newer functional programming language that lends itself well to fault tolerant and highly concurrent applications. We'll learn about the power of asynchronous processes, functional programming, and massive parallel connections while building a web application in Elixir. We'll also gain a basic understanding of Elixir syntax, and get a feel for its idiosyncrasies.

                        <p>As an underrepresented person in tech, you are often taught how to combat the outer forces of discrimination, being undermined, and overlooked. We are taught to be better, do better, outperform, tell em' who's boss-lady/enby! We are rarely given advice on how to look inside and find happiness and confidence in who we are, regardless of our circumstances, skill level or environment. This talk will be about the life-changing practice of mindfulness. This will not be an instructional on how to do 6 hour long meditations and transcend to a higher height, just the journey of a regular ass girl trying to navigate her way through life and how mindfulness helped her on the way and how mindfulness can do the same thing for you.</p>
