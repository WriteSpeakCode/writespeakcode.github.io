If that sounds terrifying—but also kinda exciting—then this workshop is for you. We’re Katel LeDû, CEO of indie tech publishing company A Book Apart, and Sara Wachter-Boettcher, a three-time author, and we know that too many valuable, interesting voices are still missing from our industry’s bookshelves. We’re here to help change that. In this workshop, we’ll demystify the publishing process and answer questions about contracts, proposals, and more. Then, you'll get to work: you’ll share ideas with us and each other, get feedback, decide on an angle and audience, and start drafting an elevator pitch and outline. You’ll leave the session with a clearer idea of what it takes to get a book published, and practical advice on turning your topic into something publishers—and readers—will love. Don’t worry about having The Perfect Idea™ before you come—just bring 1-2 topics you want to explore!",

I initially began the activity to improve my confidence and logical reasoning skills, but soon learnt that the playing field was far from fair. Despite the fact that 50% of first-year debaters were young women, by the end of their time on the circuit, most high-performing speakers were male. In this talk, I'll discuss the impact of gender-coded communication patterns not only on competitive debating performance, but also more generally in boardrooms, team meetings, and other everyday settings for technologists. I'll present research carried out by a friend who wrote a PhD on this subject, as well as insights from the fields of linguistics and behavioral psychology.",
