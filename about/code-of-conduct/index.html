            Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy
          </h1>
          <p>
            Write/Speak/Code is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
          </p>
          <p>
            This code of conduct applies to all Write/Speak/Code spaces both online
            and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or
            expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Write/Speak/Code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some Write/Speak/Code spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.
          </p>

              </li>
              <li>
                Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or after a request to stop.
              </li>
              <li>

                ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
              </li>
              <li>
                Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
              </li>
              <li>
                Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
              </li>
              <li>
                Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

            <em>
              Warnings
            </em>
            <br>
            Any member of conference staff can issue a verbal warning to a participant
            that their behavior violates the conference's anti-harassment policy.
            Warnings should be reported to info@writespeakcode.com as soon as practical.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report should include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
              </li>
              <li>
                The time you issued the warning
              </li>
              <li>
                The behavior that was in violation
              </li>
              <li>
                The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of
                warning)
              </li>
              <li>
                The circumstances surrounding the incident
              </li>
              <li>
                Your identity
              </li>
              <li>
                Other people involved in the incident
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              Presentations
            </em>
            <br>
            Presentations or similar events should not be stopped for one-time gaffes or
            minor problems, although a member of conference staff should speak to the
            presenter afterward. However, staff should take immediate action to politely
            and calmly stop any presentation or event that repeatedly or seriously
            violates the anti-harassment policy. For example, simply say "I'm sorry,
            this presentation cannot be continued at the present time" with no further
            explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              Taking Reports
            </em>
            <br>
            When taking a report from someone experiencing harassment you should record
            what they say and reassure them they are being taken seriously, but avoid
            making specific promises about what actions the organizers will take. Ask
            for any other information if the reporter has not volunteered it (such as
            time, place) but do not pressure them to provide it if they are reluctant.
            Even if the report lacks important details such as the identity of the person
            taking the harassing actions, it should still be recorded and passed along
            to the appropriate staff member(s). If the reporter desires it, arrange for
            an escort by conference staff or a trusted person, contact a friend, and
            contact local law enforcement. Do not pressure the reporter to take any
            action if they do not want to do it. Respect the reporter's privacy by not
            sharing unnecessary details with others, especially individuals who were not
            involved with the situation or non-staff members.
          </p>
          <p>
            The report should include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Identifying information (name/badge number) of the participant
              </li>
              <li>
                The time you issued the warning
              </li>
              <li>
                The behavior that was in violation
              </li>
              <li>
                The approximate time of the behavior (if different than the time of
                warning)
              </li>
              <li>
                The circumstances surrounding the incident

            <em>
              Expulsion
            </em>
            <br>
            A participant may be expelled by the decision of any of the above listed
            entities for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some
            general guidelines for when a participant should be expelled:
            <ul>
              <li>
                A third offense resulting in a warning from staff
              </li>
              <li>
                Continuing to harass after any "No" or "Stop" instruction
              </li>
              <li>
                A pattern of harassing behavior, with or without warnings
              </li>
              <li>
                A single serious offense (e.g., punching or groping someone)
              </li>
              <li>
                A single obviously intentional offense (e.g., taking up-skirt photos)
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Hotel/venue security and local authorities should be contacted when
            appropriate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              Public Statements
            </em>
            <br>
            As a general rule, conference staff should not make any public statements
            about the behavior of individual people during or after the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, consult with other staff members when possible but act when
            necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the Geek
            Feminism wiki, created by the Ada Initiative and other volunteers.
